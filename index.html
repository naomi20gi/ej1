        			<h2> Untitled: SKULL </h2>
        			<p> Many of Jean-Michel Basquiat’s paintings are in some way autobiographical, and Untitled may be considered a form of self-portraiture. The skull here exists somewhere between life and death. The eyes are listless, the face is sunken in, and the head looks lobotomized and subdued. Yet there are wild colors and spirited marks that suggest a surfeit of internal activity. Developing his own personal iconography, in this early work Basquiat both alludes to modernist appropriation of African masks and employs the mask as a means of exploring identity.</p>

        			<h2>Facts about Jean-Michel Basquiat</h2>
        			<p>The crown, Basquiat’s signature artistic motif, both acknowledged and challenged the history of Western art. By adorning black male figures, including athletes, musicians and writers, with the crown, Basquiat raised these historically disenfranchised artists to royal even saintly stature. “Jean-Michel’s crown has three peaks, for his three royal lineages: the poet, the musician, the great boxing champion,” said his friend artist Francesco Clemente.</p>

        			<h2>SAMO</h2>
        			<p>SAMO©—a shortened phrasing of “same old shit” used colloquially by Basquiat—first developed as a comic book character that doubled as a made-up religion while the two were still students at City As School High School in the West Village.

                     Soon enough, they expanded their reach tagging SAMO© (with its wry copyright symbol) along with cryptic phrases throughout SoHo and near the School of Visual Arts, often using it as a signature following political or surreal commentary that poked fun at the art world.</p>
